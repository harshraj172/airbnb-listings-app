# Airbnb Listings Assignment

## Live Demo

## What this is
This is my submission for the Airbnb listings assignment. The page loads 50 listings from a JSON file using fetch and displays them as cards.

## What it shows
- Listing name
- Description
- Price per night
- Thumbnail image
- Host name and picture
- Amenities (shows first 3)

## Creative addition
I added a search bar that lets you filter listings by typing in the name or description.

## How to run locally
You need a local server because of CORS. I used Live Server extension in VS Code - just right click the html file and open with live server.
